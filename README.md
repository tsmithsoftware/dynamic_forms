# Dynamic Forms

POC for displaying dynamic forms depending on JSON received from an API call. 
Use case is to display a different set of checks on the device depending on what country the application is registered to.

## Getting Started

This project uses Docker to set up the database and API. The docker-compose file can be found in the docs/docker/ directory.
